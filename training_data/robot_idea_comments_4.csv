On xiaomi robot cleaners its an actual feature. You can even record your own sound pack for it,false,0,
"Don't underestimate this invention...I don't think it is ahead of its time. I love what you did, but the shock value isn't something I personally would want.  You created the sounds based on existential thinking from the machine's point of view, but you could make other sound sets which related more to people owning the cleaner.  Tom Tom (the GPS device) had optional voice packs for the unit, so you could have Yosemite Sam, Kitt (Knight Rider), etc giving you directions.  I think the marketing answer is to have a set of sounds in a theme.  Examples: Mom getting mad because her Hoover vacuum cleaner just got jammed up with your underwear it sucked up (""how many times have I told you...(fill in the blank)"", the British maid (saying the same thing, but with classy sarcasm), Yoda (""move this sock to the hamper you must).  Etc, etc.  The trick is to register an id for the device, and have a location to download the voice set (after payment of course).  Now that, I would buy.  For me, the icing is if the Roomba has an event fired when it is returning to the charger.  For that: ""Screw this!  I'm taking a nap!""  Hope this helps.",false,0,

"Hmm I was looking at this guy's website thinking ""wow he is so much smarter than me... just look at his resume! Look at his website..."" Then I realized something... his experience is mainly with higher level programming languages. Java, C#, Python and Asp.net (whatever the fuck that is). He doesn't really show any indication anywhere that he is confident in writing LOW LEVEL code (in C++ (or C, although he does mention C in a very small place on his website)). In other words, he just might be the type of coder who writes ""new Object()"" everywhere and expects some ""garbage collector"" to come along and clean up after him. Does he know what a pointer is? What about a smart pointer? Thread pool? Custom memory allocator/memory pool? Stack, heap and static memory?  Dangling pointer? Memory leak? Data race? Deadlock? Coroutines? Promises? Higher-order functions? Algebraic data types? Monads (which is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, obviously)? Callbacks? Observables? Command objects? Metaclasses (part of more advanced python)?  Lisp macros? C++ templates? Finite state machines? 

Anyways, my point is that if this guy can get a job in tech, then I have a chance (because I know how to do some things that he might actually not). All I need to do, then, is make and push more side projects to github (in order to prove to people that I understand some of the concepts listed above), make myself a website (and host it on github pages because there's no need to host a static website), revamp my resume and overall just market myself better.

">wears an ""anxiety"" shirt

,,,"Haha, true dude. 

There are different forms and extents of anxiety though.  

There's your average worrisome, self isolating, in the background person who hates crowds, making phone calls or talking to new people and then there's others a bit different to this.

Some forms are where you don't have an inbetween, where half the time your either too worried and isolate yourself from others, or crowds, and then the other half of the time you also hate having anxiety and try to force yourself around others and be too hyperactive, and can't hold a normal conversation without saying stupid shit, being loud or randomly approaching strangers.

It's like some sort of Anxiety Bipolar!

He'll yeah I have this one! But, where I also write a lot of text for a comment, then sit for an hour or so contemplating whether or not to send it slowly fixing it up, along with the shit stated above. 

Personally for me if I'm being self deprecating, or being a loud and annoying douche with some sort of stupid/idiotic event, plan or other thing then I'm kinda fine, as my body is taken over with adrenaline, so I can't actually stop. Kinda like this comment right now, as I'm panicking but have invested too much time to stop, and delete.

Either way sorry for the long comment, but have an amazing day today! Bye!"

Do people actually still believe that she could fake her voice for thousands of hours on stream, (8 years worth, maybe even more) whenever she goes to live events such as Twitchcon, through hours upon hours of laughing, crying, singing, etc? (she laughs, yells, and sings quite a bit) 

Honestly, you give her WAY too much credit. 

Even the most accomplished voice actor would not be able to keep up the same routine for 4 hours straight, 4-5 times per week. (I've even seen her do 10 hours streams) 

They take breaks, and often need to do things in multiple takes. 

Honestly, she would deserve an Emmy if she would be able to do even half of what people are claiming.

,,,"Impossible. I understand that it was specifically created to feel pain, but a robot can only have so much of a capacity to distain it’s very existence. Meanwhile, humans have free will, and with said free will comes the eventual realization that even complaining about how everything is for naught is for naught. Why even bother making modified Roombas when you and it aren’t even the only ones screaming into the inky void? Sure, It’s not alive; It’s just an empty shell with no true purpose other than to entertain beings of higher intelligence. But can we really be certain we aren’t the exact same thing just described? Can we really be certain that there even are beings of higher intelligence? For all we know, we could be all alone, hurtling through the endless cosmos with not a single shred of life sharing our plight. Hell, maybe all of existence is just a simulation, or the dream of an organism we’ll never know, or maybe some entirely different concept we have no ability to truly grasp. The truth of the matter is that nothing matters. There is no God, there is no meaning, there is no ultimate goal. It’s all just a vacuum, devoid of hope and purpose. That’s it.

So, basically, all of existence is just a giant, screaming Roomba that moves around aimlessly and has extremely little, if any, soul."

Instead of コーデイングをする人 (coding wo suru hito)、コーデイング男 (coding otoko) as translation for ""Coding Man"" would make more sense since the first case actually conjugates the verb ""to code"" whereas you just want to use the gerund by itself like the second case

Also, when you wrote 欠を食べる (ketsu wo taberu)、I realized you wanted to say ""I eat ass""
While 欠 and 穴 both have the same reading, they have vastly different meaning. The first means deficiency while the second means ass.
Hence, you meant to write 穴を食べる (ketsu wo taberu)

Maybe make it to where you have to run a bit farther than the boundaries of your house before it disarms itself, just to add a bit of urgency. If you're not dead due to Monster after programming that, make it count your steps to a set amount that must be achieved before you are allowed to go home.
