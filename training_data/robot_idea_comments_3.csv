,,,Same
,,,UnseenSight YT same
,,,"(Here's another answer to your dumb, careful probing) 
No! Now code motherf#nn‚âàfaahckor ok. Ja? 
Now if and when you start your engineering channel do the same as Michael but try to understand that people like this kind of content becos it's DIY (meaning U CAN DO IT WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO GOOOD Equipment & Materials) and that makes it eye-opening yeah.. and all that makes you relatable. Include friends and paid actors to give that lonely audience the feelin of being less lonely and more optimistic... Pepple also like VaRiEtY so blend shit together with that ""programming"", pop_scifi content, life-hacking, cos we all wanna learn, to save our helpless directionless souls from endless misery and potential homelessness. Try motivational pillowtalk/obnoxious pandering with sprinkles o' comedy, ""bad acting"" and edginess or whatever üòè. Do collabs for more views and try be asthetickally enlightened to groom your hungry fans for the merch phase. Bonus is you can gather so much data for more ideas. 
Learn to sell ""yourself"" and by all means use your brand for sponsorship deals.
Unless you're stupid. 
Lastly pat your back you're not a hopeless loser and enjoy crying less. Then count the days til your first or next NeRvOuS BreakDown.  Use a friend or ""friend"" with a drone or some handheld video recorder device to save money and time and make you seem more trustworthy and approachable. . . Also for emotional support. 
Get an Animal or fisch or whatever.
Try to appeal to minorities cos minorities are kinda cool and exotic yo. 
Make effective use of music, sounds, ambience and silence. 
Make effective use of social media.
Lastly include pretty girls wherever possible and using the same thinking from the above get family involved unless your family hates or simply doesn't give a shit about you.. so use actors. 
It's your life fuckboy k buddy sorryy default setting is hatred cos I don't have enough patience nor do I have all the meds I need. 
I need them but they're expensive. Gofundme.

I challenge you to create an offline / Off the Grid GPS like mapping system using a compass, a step tracker, solar power, and any screen you can adapt for the project. The goal isn't to create a full-blown GPS mapping system so much as it is to create an instantaneous route mapping system, IRM ( instant route mapper ) for short. You have to be able to track your path back. Though of course any other tricks you can add to it to further the accuracy of the mapping system is great. But the biggest thing is portability.

I was honestly genuinely surprised that you guys caught a fish with that thing, albeit the size of 'em, this was an awesome video and an awesome fishing pole that I 100% would not buy. Seems like more struggle, and it takes the fun of reeling 'em in with your own two hands...

,,,"‚ÄúMammals share the same nervous system, neurochemicals, perceptions, and emotions, all of which are integrated into the experience of pain, says Marc Bekoff, evolutionary biologist and author.‚Äù

‚ÄúFish do not feel pain the way humans do, according to a team of neurobiologists, behavioral ecologists and fishery scientists. The researchers conclude that fish do not have the neuro-physiological capacity for a conscious awareness of pain.‚Äù

All with a simple google search"
,,,"@pineapple dude, the literal first result says otherwise. https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/factory-farming/fish/fish-feel-pain/"
,,,"@pineapple plus, if you actually read that article, you'd know that the conclusion, "" fish don't feel pain like humans,"" does not equal, ""fish don't feel any pain."" üòÇ"
,,,"Matthew Spencer
The chunk I sent you literally says that fish do not have the ability to feel pain.  I also read through the thing, and it actually concludes by saying that they either don‚Äôt feel pain or they feel pain in a different way, so actually, nobody knows.  So, if YOU had read through it, you‚Äôd have known that it was INCONCLUSIVE."
,,,"@pineapple buddy, you're an idiot. I never said your article was conclusive. On the contrary, I alluded to it being inconclusive because I actually did read it. You obviously didn't until I pointed the out. Also, the article was from 2013. If you read past that, the next 3-4 on the first page of Google results said otherwise, one being from the Smithsonian! üòÇ

But all that's irrelevant, because you made the claim, so you need to provide evidence. The fact that the article you first provided doesn't support your claim, was kinda my whole point. üòÇ

Edit: All I'm saying is that he should've pulled the hook out. Calm down"
,,,"Matthew Spencer 
Why are you telling me to calm down when you threw out the first insult?  But I mean, putting that aside, it seemed more like you were alluding to fish definitively feeling pain, when there was also evidence refuting it.  When you said ‚Äúin the conclusion,‚Äù I just kinda automatically assumed you thought you had found a, well, conclusion saying that fish 100% feel pain.  I guess I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve angered you, but please know that (((both of us can technically be right or wrong)))"
,,,"@pineapple I definitely wasn't the one who was being condescending first. üòÇ
Also, I'm not angry. No, there's not evidence refuting both our claims, at least not in the ""evidence"" you've provided. We CAN both be wrong, but that's not the case currently."
,,,"Matthew Spencer
Well, the literal second comment you left was super passive aggressive, but okay"
,,,"@pineapple asking you to prove your statement? How is that passive aggressive? üòÇ

Grow up"
,,,"Matthew Spencer 
Very cool, asking for proof isn‚Äôt inherently passive aggressive, but how you put it made you seem like a massive bellend. Way to prove it"
,,,"@pineapple if ""prove it"" is passive aggressive, I'd like to point to your next comment's last statement."
,,,"@pineapple no it didn't. üòÇ

It's really not my fault you thought I was being passive aggressive, given there was nothing I said that a normal person would actually take as passive aggressive. üòÇ

They do have electric spin-cast reels that work as well. Some are as simple as motors that attach to the handle bolt and either have a battery incorporated or plug into one on a belt clip. The applications for disabled people who have trouble using their hands due to arthritis, stroke, amputation, or any number of reasons are great.
